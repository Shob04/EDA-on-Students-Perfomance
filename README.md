# EDA-on-Students-Perfomance


## Overview
This project is about analyzing a dataset of students' marks in different subjects. We started by cleaning the data if needed. Then, we performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand how the marks vary, using summary statistics, visualizations, and statistical tests. We also looked for any patterns or correlations between the variables, depending on the questions that came up during the analysis.

## Data Availablity
The data was directly obtained from Kaggle.

## Methodology
Some of the key methods which were used throughout the work are:

1) Data cleaning
2) Visualization - EDA
3) Summary statistics & Statistical Hypothesis Testing
